# Notebook

Ever since I wanted to be a developer, I've kept a notebook. This notebook contains my app ideas, questions, answers, designs, and meetup notes as I learned to be a developer in school and in my `career || personal projects`. In each post of this section, I'll share a page of my notebook and explain my intention at the time and what I would change today.

###### We all face challenges at every professional level, I did and still do, feel free to reach out with any questions.
