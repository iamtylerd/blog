# Notebook

Going forward I am going to write about my notebook.  I bought this notebook the day before I started school.  It is full of "stuff".  Things I have learned, things I wanted to make, things I didn't understand.  I am hoping this will show the evolution of someone who started school to someone who has been a proffessional developer for 3+ years now.  

###### You will see that everyone struggles and everyone has 'dumb' questions
