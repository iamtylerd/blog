# From?
I'm from a small city in Tennessee called McMinnville, but now we live in Chicago and the weather sucks.  It's not very big, but we do have a Shoney's.
# School?
I went to college at Middle Tennessee State University and software school at Nashville Software School.
# Fun?
I love a good IPA or Pilsner, thin crust meat pizza, and a movie with a hell of a twist.  I spend a lot of time at the gym and playing video games.  I am a huge **Vanderbilt** and **Nashville Predators** fan.
# Family?
